## Installation
Clone this repository to your machine.
Move it into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/MetalMatze/cubbyhole/`.

### run.sh
Use `./run.sh` to fetch dependencies and start the server.

### Without run.sh
First of all run `go get ./...` to fetch the few dependencies.
Now you can start the server by running `go run main.go`.
If you want to create a binary, do so by running `go build`.
